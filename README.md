# Music Lyrics Generator App

This project is a Firebase and React-based web application that allows users to generate song lyrics using AI. The backend is powered by Firebase Functions, integrated with OpenAI's GPT model to generate lyrics based on a user's input.

## Features

- Generate song lyrics based on user prompts
- Different music styles such as Pop, Jazz, Classical, etc.
- Deployed on Firebase Hosting
- Backend integrated with OpenAI using Firebase Functions

## Prerequisites

To work with this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or above)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)
- [OpenAI API Key](https://beta.openai.com/signup/)

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running locally and deploy it to Firebase.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/allyelvis/musicgenerator.git
cd musicgenerator
```

### Step 2: Install Firebase CLI and Login

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
```

### Step 3: Initialize Firebase Functions

Go to the `functions` directory and install necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd functions
npm install
```

Make sure to replace the `openai.apiKey` in `index.js` with your own OpenAI API key.

### Step 4: Run Firebase Locally

You can emulate Firebase functions locally using the Firebase CLI:

```bash
firebase emulators:start
```

To call the function locally:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/<your-project-id>/us-central1/generateLyrics -d '{"prompt":"Compose a reflective song for times of sadness, calm."}'
```

### Step 5: Deploy Firebase Functions

Once everything is set up, deploy the Firebase Functions and hosting:

```bash
firebase deploy --only functions,hosting
```

This will deploy the backend to Firebase Functions and your app to Firebase Hosting.

## Firebase Function: Generate Song Lyrics

The Firebase Function to generate song lyrics is located in `functions/index.js`. It uses OpenAI's API to generate song lyrics based on user prompts.

**Example Request:**

```json
{
  "prompt": "Compose a reflective song for times of sadness, calm."
}
```

**Example Response:**

```json
{
  "lyrics": "In the quiet of the night, when all is still and calm..."
}
```
